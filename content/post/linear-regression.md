Machine learning has been all the rage for the last few years. Luckily, there are many good resources on the subject. If you are looking for a MOOC on machine learning, I found both Caltech's [Learning From Data]( http://www.work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html) and Stanford's [Andrew Ng's famous Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course to be quite good.

As to programming languages choices, recently the development of the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language has caught my eye. Julia has a lot of qualities that make it a very good candidate for scientific computing, both as a prototyping language (a much better alternative to Matlab) and to make production-grade applications (Julia's performance is comparable to C). Check out their [website](https://julialang.org/) for a full description of the language.

However, I have not found that many introductory material to machine learning in Julia on the internet, so I decided to create one myself.

[Here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/owayss/Intro-to-Machine-Learning-in-Julia/blob/master/LinealRegression.ipynb) is a Jupyter notebook I created on Linear regression.
